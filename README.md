# Project-StyleGuide
<em>Project for Codecademy</em>

This is a <strong>project</strong> made for the <strong>Full-Stack Engineer</strong> program at Codecademy.

For this <strong>project</strong> i needed to make a <strong>Style guide website</strong>.

It had to contain a <strong>Color Palette</strong>, a few <strong>Fonts</strong>, and i had to demonstrate some <strong>Text Styles</strong>.

As an <strong>extra</strong>, I decided to make the website <strong>responsive</strong> so that it also looks good on mobile devices. This was not needed for the project but i thought it would be nice to do so =)
